# 100 Days of Code - LED Edition

This project was a learning exercise for myself. I was fascinated by bitwise operators and I thought of a this project where I can use them.

Future iterations might include a female micro USB port, in order to close the altoids tin.

This current iteration only works on my local network by visiting a static IP address.

Below are a few images of the project and of the wiring schematic.
